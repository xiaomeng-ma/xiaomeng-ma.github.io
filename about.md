My research interests are in language acquisition and syntax.</p>
<p>In language acquisition, I am trying to understand to what extent the syntactical structure can be aquired through statistical learning. My approach is to apply machine learning and neural network techniques to corpora of child-adult verbal interaction on <a href="https://childes.talkbank.org/" style="color:red">CHILDES</a>. </p>

<p>
In syntax, I am interested in applicative structure and my general research question is why some languages don't have double object construction. I have worked with Mandarin Chinese and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamum_language" style="color:red">Shupamem</a>.</p>

<p>
I also have experience in experimental methods, such as eye-tracking, EEG, fMRI and behavioral tests with young children.
