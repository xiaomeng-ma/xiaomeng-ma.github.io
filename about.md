My research areas mainly focus on language acquisition and NLP/NLU. It is intriguing how few data babies need in order to learn to speak; while with the whole wikipedia available we still can't train a machine to talk like a baby. I am interested in understanding the learning mechanism of human infants in order to improve data efficiency in neural network models. </p>

I also work on syntax. I am interested in applicative structure and my current research question is why some languages don't have double object construction. I have worked with Mandarin Chinese and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamum_language" style="color:red">Shupamem</a>.</p>

<p>I am proficient in machine learning and deep learning skills for applications in various NLP/NLU tasks. I am looking for machine learning/NLP internship opportunities, please don't hesitate to send me an email or hit me up on linkedin. </p>
